Some labs to study distributed systems:

## Lab1: MapReduce


### Prepared

A simple sequential mapreduce implementation: 
    src/main/mrsequential.go. 
A couple of MapReduce applications: 
    word-count in mrapps/wc.go, and a text indexer in mrapps/indexer.go. 

```
go build -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go
rm mr-out*
go run mrsequential.go wc.so pg*.txt
more mr-out-0
```

### TODO

To implement a distributed MapReduce, consisting of two programs, the master and the worker. 

```
go build -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go
```

In the main directory, run the master.
```
rm mr-out*
go run mrmaster.go pg-*.txt
```

In one or more other windows, run some workers:
```
go run mrworker.go wc.so
```
